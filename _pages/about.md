My journey into technology began during my soul-searching undergraduate years when I studied Media Arts at [New Jersey City University (NJCU)](https://www.njcu.edu) and Film & Video at the [School of Visual Arts (SVA)](https://sva.edu).

The art of storytelling and design inspires my work as a fullstack software engineer. Managing and presenting data for [Columbia University's](https://www.columbia.edu) Office of Alumni & Development enabled me to realize that I thoroughly enjoyed discovering, organizing, and presenting stories derived from the underbelly of transformed data. I decided to study Computer Science for my undergraduate degree at [Montclair State University (MSU)](https://www.montclair.edu).

I specialize in UI/UX and full-stack development, with a deep interest in how agentic AI is transforming the world. When I'm not training my design or builder muscles with a new technology from scratch or grinding Leetcode, you can find me exploring the rich worlds of yoga, books, and video games, which constantly inspire my creative and technical projects.
