My journey into technology began in the arts, studying media arts at [New Jersey City University (NJCU)](https://www.njcu.edu) and film at the [School of Visual Arts (SVA)](https://sva.edu) during my soul-searching undergraduate years. This creative foundation in storytelling inspires my work as a software engineer and designer. After transitioning to computer science at [Montclair State University (MSU)](https://www.montclair.edu), I have found my canvas for building memorable experiences.

I specialize in UI/UX and full-stack development, with a deep interest in how agentic AI is transforming the world. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the rich worlds of books and video games, which constantly inspire my creative and technical projects.
