My journey into technology began during my soul-searching undergraduate years when I studied Media Arts at [New Jersey City University (NJCU)](https://www.njcu.edu) and Film & Video at the [School of Visual Arts (SVA)](https://sva.edu). This creative foundation in storytelling inspires my work as a software engineer and designer. After having worked for [Columbia University's](https://www.columbia.edu) Office of Alumni & Development for 5+ years in Data Management, I realized that I liked telling stories through concrete data so much that I transitioned away from the Arts into studying Computer Science for my undergraduate degree at [Montclair State University (MSU)](https://www.montclair.edu). Here, I have found my canvas for building memorable stories and experiences with data.

I specialize in UI/UX and full-stack development, with a deep interest in how agentic AI is transforming the world. When I'm not building a technology from scratch or grinding Leetcode, you can find me exploring the rich worlds of books and video games, which constantly inspire my creative and technical projects.
