My journey into technology began in the arts, studying music at [New Jersey City University (NJCU)](https://www.njcu.edu) and film at the [School of Visual Arts (SVA)](https://sva.edu). This creative foundation in storytelling and user experience now informs my work as a software engineer and designer. After transitioning to computer science at [Montclair State University (MSU)](https://www.montclair.edu), I found a new medium for my passion for building things.

Today, I specialize in UI/UX and full-stack development, with a keen interest in how AI is transforming the field. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the rich worlds of video games, which constantly inspire my creative and technical projects.
